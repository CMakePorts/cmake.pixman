  - Remove the warning suppression in the ACCESS_MEM macro and fix the
    warnings that are real

  - It probably makes sense to move the more strange X region API
    into pixman as well, but guarded with PIXMAN_XORG_COMPATIBILITY

  - Go through things marked FIXME

  - Reinstate the FbBits conditional typedef? At the moment we don't
    even have the FbBits type; we just use uint32_t everywhere.

    Keith says in bug 2335:

        The 64-bit code in fb (pixman) is probably broken; it hasn't been
        used in quite some time as PCI (and AGP) is 32-bits wide, so
        doing things 64-bits at a time is a net loss.  To quickly fix
        this, I suggest just using 32-bit datatypes by setting
        IC_SHIFT to 5 for all machines.

  - Test if pseudo color still works
