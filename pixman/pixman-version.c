/**
 * pixman_version:
 *
 * Returns the version of the pixman library encoded in a single
 * integer as per %PIXMAN_VERSION_ENCODE. The encoding ensures that
 * later versions compare greater than earlier versions.
 *
 * A run-time comparison to check that pixman's version is greater than
 * or equal to version X.Y.Z could be performed as follows:
 *
 * <informalexample><programlisting>
 * if (pixman_version() >= PIXMAN_VERSION_ENCODE(X,Y,Z)) {...}
 * </programlisting></informalexample>
 *
 * See also pixman_version_string() as well as the compile-time
 * equivalents %PIXMAN_VERSION and %PIXMAN_VERSION_STRING.
 *
 * Return value: the encoded version.
